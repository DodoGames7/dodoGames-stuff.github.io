# Askers

## Early version of settings command

In a very early version of askers version 1.0.0, instead of using buttons to change current settings, you were instead required to go into certain category to manage them. The idea was scrapped with the final beta build of 1.0.0.

The embed color was also changed from green to yellow in the final beta build as well.

## 1.0.1

Askers version 1.0.1 is a cancelled build of Askers for aoi.js v5. It was the version where it's supposed to have the languages feature but due to v5 being breaking by discord api changes, 1.0.1 was cancelled and it was replaced by 1.0.2 to provide support for aoi.js v6 (alongside with the language feature).
